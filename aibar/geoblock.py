"""Geo-block ("no VPN") detection for providers unreachable without VPN.

Claude, Codex and the OpenAI API answer HTTP 403 when reached from a
geo-blocked network. Instead of watching VPN adapters, we check the thing
that actually matters — endpoint reachability — with anonymous requests that
carry NO credentials. Verified live: without VPN the Cloudflare edge answers
403 to anonymous requests on all three domains; with VPN they answer
404/401/200.

Probe-first: every poll cycle ONE anonymous check decides for all gated
providers (the block is shared). On 403 the authenticated fetches are
skipped entirely: no token leaves the machine without VPN.

Detection is a cascade because a single URL is not reliable: the anthropic
usage endpoint was seen answering 429 (rate limit) to anonymous requests,
which masked the geo-block. Ambiguous answers (429, network error) fall
through to the next detector; only a clear 403 blocks, any other clear
status opens. All detectors ambiguous -> fail open, so a fully offline
machine shows honest network errors instead of a misleading "no VPN".
